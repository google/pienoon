// This file defines the schema for a finite state machine that represents the
// state of a game character.
//
//     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine
//
// A character can be in one of many states, and as the game progresses the
// character will transition between them based on what the player does and what
// happens to them. For example, when a player presses the button assigned to
// `ThrowPie`, the ThrowPie bit will be set, and the character might transition
// into its `Throwing` state.
